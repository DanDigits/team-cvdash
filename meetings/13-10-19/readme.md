# Pretrained Models and Finetuning / Transfer Learning

To reproduce the demonstration, clone the OIDv4 toolkit (https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit). Make sure you have the packages in the requirements.txt file. Run the script to download the subset of data used. The data is about 800M.

I made this scripts quickly based on a previous project that used finetuning. There are places for improvement and cleaner code.
